Food Recipe App
Project Author: Sharon Nyamongo

Project Description
This is an app that allows you to get a meal's recipe by keying in a specific ingredient.
You input an ingredient, then press the search button.
You'll then get a list of all available meals that can be prepared using that ingredient.
It also shows a recipe and a list of other ingredients used in that meal together with their quantities.
